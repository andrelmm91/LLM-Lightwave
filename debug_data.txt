This is a story about a cat. The cat liked to code. It coded all day long.
But the code had bugs. The bugs were complex.
Wait, this needs to be longer.
I will write more text to ensure we have enough characters for the sequence length.
Sequence length is 128 tokens? Or characters?
The code does `tokenizer.encode(chunk)`.
It slices `full_text` by characters (lines 36-37). `full_text[start:start+length]`. `length=SEQ_LEN=128`.
So we need ~130 characters.
