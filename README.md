> **"Where Light Meets Language."**  
> LLM Lightwave is a revolutionary, complex-valued language model inspired by the principles of photonic interference and quantum wave propagation. By operating in the complex domain ($\mathbb{C}$), it captures the phase and magnitude of linguistic features with unprecedented efficiency.

## 🚀 Why Lightwave?

Traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) treat tokens as static points in a real-valued vector space. **Lightwave evolves them.**

Built on the cutting edge of **Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNNs)**, Lightwave simulates the behavior of lightwaves as they cascade through interference layers, allowing for:
- **Phase-Aware Context**: Naturally encoding sequence timing and relational depth.
- **Unitary Efficiency**: Extremely low-parameter "Wave" mode using Quantum Random Walks.
- **Triple-Adaptive Interference**: Coupling that learns unique dynamics across **Epochs**, **Steps (M)**, and **Layers** simultaneously.
- **Dynamic Evolution**: A stateful, temporal architecture that treats memory as a field.
