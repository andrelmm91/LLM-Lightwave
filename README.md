> **"Where Light Meets Language."**  
> LLM Lightwave is a revolutionary, complex-valued language model inspired by the principles of photonic interference and quantum wave propagation. By operating in the complex domain ($\mathbb{C}$), it captures the phase and magnitude of linguistic features with unprecedented efficiency.

## 🚀 Why Lightwave?

Traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) treat tokens as static points in a real-valued vector space. **Lightwave evolves them.**

Built on the cutting edge of **Complex-Valued Neural Networks (CVNNs)**, Lightwave simulates the behavior of lightwaves as they cascade through interference layers, allowing for:
- **Phase-Aware Context**: Naturally encoding sequence timing and relational depth.
- **Unitary Efficiency**: Extremely low-parameter "Wave" mode using Quantum Random Walks.
*   **Triple-Adaptive Interference**: Coupling and Phase that learn unique dynamics across **Epochs**, **Steps (M)**, and **Layers** simultaneously.
- **Dynamic Evolution**: A stateful, temporal architecture that treats memory as a field.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 Complex-Valued Core
*   **High-Dimensional $\mathbb{C}$ Space**: Scaled-up embeddings for enhanced linguistic capacity and reduced feature collision.
*   **Mish-Complex Activation**: Non-linear mapping preserving phase information across deep cascades.
*   **Amplitude & Phase Modulation**: Dual-domain learning that tunes field intensity and rotation for precise interference.
*   **Complex LayerNorm**: Independent normalization of magnitude and phase for maximum stability.

### ⚡ Advanced Architectures
*   **Multi-Head Modulator**: A Dot-Product Attention upgrade designed for the complex domain.
*   **Quantum Wave Mode**: Run with **zero trainable parameters** in the modulator core, utilizing pure unitary interference with **Ballistic Spread** and **Reflecting Boundaries** for enhanced feature mixing.
*   **Cascaded Interference**: Scalable multi-stage propagation (up to 12+ layers) for deep reasoning.

### 🛠️ Professional Tooling
*   **RLVR (Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards)**: Self-improving policy gradient loop for targeted task success.
*   **PEFT (LoRA & 4-bit Quantization)**: Fine-tune massive architectures on consumer hardware and prepare for optical substrates.
*   **Beam Search Decoding**: High-precision text generation with configurable width.
*   **Mini-Batch Training**: Parallel processing of multiple sequences for 10-20x GPU utilization improvement.
